The really cool thing about APIs is that they allow you to stitch a solution together pretty quickly - at least the good ones do :)
As it turns out, this is a great idea for hackathons - when you only have a few hours to produce something that will be able to show to the world. Yesterday’s [Railsberry](http://railsberry.com) API Bakeoff was sponsored by [Tropo](http://tropo.com) and [Future Simple](http://futuresimple.com). Tropo adds Voice, SMS and IM support to your applications and [Base](http://futuresimple.com/base) is a CRM system that allows you to track your sales and contacts with ease.

EXCERPT

Everybody was free to work on whatever they wanted but it is these two APIs that attendees abused the most :)
And so [canimus](https://github.com/canimus) created an app that could retrieve a contact from Base, call that person’s phone number and play her a pre-recorded message. Cano actually used it to call his friend in the US to say ‘Hi’ :)

[@antoniolorusso](http://twitter.com/antoniolorusso), [@teoulas](http://twitter.com/teoulas) and [@ludvik_pl](http://twitter.com/ludvik_pl) from [Pusher](http://pusher.com) put 3 different APIs together. Their app could create contacts in Base after receiving SMS. Additionally, Pusher’s API would send a push notification to their web app and update it in real time. Now, how cool is that?

[@michalbugno](http://twitter.com/michalbugno) and [@oinopion](http://twitter.com/oinopion) made it possible to sync Google Spreadsheets with Base while [@evilchelu](http://twitter.com/evilchelu) and [@dira_geek_girl](http://twitter.com/dira_geek_girl) worked on a nutrition calculator based on Wolphram Alpha API. [@eatingbits](http://twitter.com/eatingbits), [@Peter_Lind](http://twitter.com/peter_lind) and [@PatrikStenmark](http://twitter.com/patrikstenmark) created an app that presents tweets about Railsberry on a Google Map and [@makevoid](http://twitter.com/makevoid)’s project allows you to see where exactly on the map all Facebook events in your city are happening - [eventyd](http://github.com/makevoid/eventyd).

There were many more ideas and discussions going on throughout the evening - these just examples of how many cool things can be built in just a few hours. 

Thank you all for coming and coding together. We all had lots of fun :)
Take care and have fun at Railsberry.
