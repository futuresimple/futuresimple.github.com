During this weekend a part of the Futuresimple team
([Marcin](http://twitter.com/marcinbunsch),
[Michal](http://twitter.com/michalbugno),
[Przemek](http://twitter.com/powczarek), and
[me](http://twitter.com/antekpiechnik)) went to Wrocław to attend
[wroc_love.rb](http://wrocloverb.com) - a Ruby conference organised by
the [Lower Silesian Ruby User Group](http://www.drug.org.pl). We'd like
to share our experiences.

EXCERPT

We left Kraków on Friday evening and arrived just in time for the before
party.  We met some amazing developers, i.e. [Nick
Sutterer](http://twitter.com/apotonick), [Steve
Klabnik](http://twitter.com/steveklabnik). After a few beers we went
home to get ready for the first day of the conference.

On Saturday Nick Sutterer gave a relaxed talk about respect in the open
source community. Of all the talks we were especially interested in one
by [Piotr Sarnacki](http://twitter.com/drogus) about the [past, present
and the future of the Ruby on Rails
framework](http://rails-present-past-future.heroku.com/#1). Being a core
contributor, he provided the attendees with some great in-depth info on
the framework's recent history, its current development status and
features that gained much attention lately, i.e. building API-based
applications in Rails. Another [great
talk](http://decoupling-wrocloverb-2012.heroku.com/) was delivered by
[Piotr Szotkowski](http://twitter.com/chastell) and dealt with methods
of decoupling persistence from models in Ruby apps. The presentation was
quite detailed and technical, but Piotr managed to cover a lot of
different aspects while keeping us extremely gripped. By the end of the
day we attended a talk on Data Context Integration approach by [Jim
Gay](http://twitter.com/saturnflyer). We got really intrigued and as
soon as we get a chance, we'll consider adopting.

The next day we woke up to a talk on improving yourself as a programmer
by [Michał Taszycki](http://twitter.com/mehowte). We encourage you to
skim through his
[slides](http://speakerdeck.com/u/mehowte/p/programming-workout) and
register yourself at [Programming
Workout](http://programmingworkout.com). Another great talk was
delivered by [Steve Klabnik](http://twitter.com/steveklabnik) and
covered creating REST Hypermedia APIs. Even though we are not planning
on employing that anytime soon, it was great to see someone tackle and
present the problem. Next up, [Roy Tomeij](http://twitter.com/roy) gave
a [talk](http://roy.io/wl12) about Modular, Reusable Frontend Code and
Bob Ross. We have to admit we loved all the tips and ideas. Ideally,
we'll want to take it on in both our current and upcoming projects.
This talk was followed by a panel discussing _Rails vs OOP_, led by
[Andrzej Krzywda](http://twitter.com/andrzejkrzywda) and consisting of
Piotr Szotkowski, Steve Klabnik, Nick Sutterer and Jim Gay. It was an
extremely interesting discussion that even involved the audience
multiple times.

To sum up, it's been a great few days, we are really happy to have been
a part of it and would love to attend it in the future.  It's amazing to
see new programming-related events taking place here in Poland. Once again
we'd like to thank the organizers of the conference. Great job!
