Third meet.js in Kraków is no more! [Future
Simple](http://www.futuresimple.com/) had a pleasure to be a big part of it. We
sponsored beer, one speaker and few attendees :) But how was it?  Here’re our
impressions.

EXCERPT

Drukarnia is a very nice place for this kind of events. There are drinks, food
and plenty of space available. The only missing thing is Internet downstairs,
Drukarnia should really invest in wi-fi. All started at 6:15 pm when our very
own [Marcin Bunsch](https://twitter.com/marcinbunsch) took a stage.

He delivered a presentation about
[Backbone.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/) fundamentals, going
through main elements of the framework. He also presented how to make it work
with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating engine. After the
presentation Marcin answered some interesting questions about Backbone. JS
frameworks are hot today and it was very nice to see speech about it, we need
more!

Next up was [Krzysztof Kula](https://twitter.com//krzychukula) and he was
talking about testing JS. Personally I liked the talk however I think it had
enough content for a lightning talk but not for a full speech. Krzysztof
mentioned why testing JS is important and how to make it faster using static
test runners like [buster.js](http://busterjs.org/).

Right after Krzysztof, Grzegorz started his speech about Node.js in a big scale.
Grzegorz works for DreamLab at Onet.pl. He started by describing how Onet
infrastructure looks like. It’s called Onet Cloud and looks like a subset of
Amazon EC2. Then he introduced a concept that made a crowd anxious. All Onet
Cloud production boxes die after 90 minutes. Apparently it’s a design that is
supposed to make infrastructure more bullet-proof but I still don’t know why
after 90 minutes and not after 60 minutes and why to kill them at all! It looks
like a poor-mans implementation of [Chaos
Monkey](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/04/working-with-the-chaos-monkey.html)
I didn’t feel that talk answered the question how to scale Node.js and why they
decided to use Node in the first place. “Stateless web apps”? Come on!

Last talk was delivered by [Sławek](https://twitter.com/hfrntt) and it concerned
SVG vs Canvas. One could easily see that Sławek had spend a lot of time working
both with Canvas and SVG and he’s the guy you want to talk about this stuff. We
had a chance to see a few demos comparing performance and responsiveness, there
was also nice scaling example done using Firefox logo. Then Sławek talked about
SVG files sizes and concluded with browser support.

Wrapping up, meet.js #3 was a decent meeting, gathered quite a big crowd and
provoked discussions. See you next time!
